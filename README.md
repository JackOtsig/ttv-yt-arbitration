# ttv-yt-arbitration
a bot to arbitrate twitch clips to youtube in a compilation format.

currently on hold due to the rapid decline of twitch, will keep an eye out.

few to many key information files and folder structures are missing to prevent ease of use from you scallywags but could be easily reverse engineered.

there were many successful trial runs bubt i never made it to deployment due to problems with youtube API, thumbnail creation, and somehting to do with russian phone numbers. maybe if im confident twitch will make a comeback i'll come back to this but after 2 months of my life gone this project is dead in the water.
